# download_file_from_github
### This code can be used to download files in one dir, if there are multi dirs it's not sutiable.
### I will add more functions to support multi dirs soon...
### for example, replace the target with your url
```python
target = 'https://github.com/QSCTech/zju-icicles/tree/master/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA/%E8%AF%95%E5%8D%B7'
```
