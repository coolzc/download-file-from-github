# Download files from github
##### This code can be used to download files in one dir, if there are multi dirs it's not sutiable.
##### I will add more functions to support multi dirs soon...
###### please make sure you have installed 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup' 
###### How to use: 
###### for example, replace the target with your url, then python it in your terminal, 
```python
target = 'your url'
```
