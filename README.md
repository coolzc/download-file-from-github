# Download files from github
##### This code can be used to download files in one dir, if there are multi dirs it's not sutiable.
##### I will add more functions to support multi dirs soon...
###### please make sure you have installed 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup' 
###### How to use: 
###### for example, replace the target with your url, then python it in your terminal, 
```python
target = 'your url'
```

#### Need to improve
1. support async task to download files
2. support to download files in multi directories 
3. support to download files to specific path and url designated by terminal input
